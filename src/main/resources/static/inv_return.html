            <h3>What Is Return on Investment (ROI)?</h3>
            <p class="text-par">
                Return on Investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or
                compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. ROI tries to directly measure the amount of
                return on a particular investment, relative to the investment’s cost. To calculate ROI, the benefit (or
                return) of an investment is divided by the cost of the investment. The result is expressed as a
                percentage or a ratio.</p>

            <h3>How to Calculate ROI</h3>
            <p class="text-par">
                The return on investment formula is as follows:
                <br>
                ROI=Current Value of Investment−Cost of InvestmentCost of Investment\begin{aligned} &\text{ROI} =
                \dfrac{\text{Current Value of Investment}-\text{Cost of Investment}}{\text{Cost of Investment}}\\
                \end{aligned}​ROI=Cost of Investment

            <h3>Developments in ROI</h3>
            <p class="text-par">
                Recently, certain investors and businesses have taken an interest in the development of a new form of
                the ROI metric, called "Social Return on Investment," or SROI. SROI was initially developed in the early
                2000s and takes into account broader impacts of projects using extra-financial value (i.e. social and
                environmental metrics not currently reflected in conventional financial accounts). SROI helps understand
                the value proposition of certain ESG (Environmental Social & Governance) criteria used in socially
                responsible investing (SRI) practices. For instance, a company may undertake to recycle water in its
                factories and replace its lighting with all LED bulbs. These undertakings have an immediate cost which
                may negatively impact traditional ROI—however, the net benefit to society and the environment could lead
                to a positive SROI

                There are several other new flavors of ROI that have been developed for particular purposes. Social
                media statistics ROI pinpoints the effectiveness of social media campaigns—for example how many clicks
                or likes are generated for a unit of effort. Similarly, marketing statistics ROI tries to identify the
                return attributable to advertising or marketing campaigns. So-called learning ROI relates to the amount
                of information learned and retained as return on education or skills training. As the world progresses
                and the economy changes, several other niche forms of ROI are sure to be developed in the future. (For

            <h3>Limitations of ROI</h3>
            <p class="text-par">
                Examples like Joe's (above) reveal some limitations of using ROI, particularly when comparing
                investments. While the ROI of Joe’s second investment was twice that of his first investment, the time
                between Joe’s purchase and sale was one year for his first investment and three years for his second.

                Joe could adjust the ROI of his multi-year investment accordingly. Since his total ROI was 40 percent,
                to obtain his average annual ROI, he could divide 40 percent by 3 to yield 13.33 percent. With this
                adjustment, it appears that although Joe’s second investment earned him more profit, his first
                investment was actually the more efficient choice.

                ROI can be used in conjunction with Rate of Return, which takes into account a project’s time frame. One
                may also use Net Present Value (NPV), which accounts for differences in the value of money over time,
                due to inflation. The application of NPV when calculating rate of return is often called the Real Rate
                of Return.</p>
